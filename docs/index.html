    <H1>Lab 1 (List App)</H1>
    <H2>Empty List</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1EmptyList.html" id="emptyList"></iframe>
        <p> The empty list starts with the assigned title at the top and a short message which prompts the user to tap. The user will be able to anywhere in the lines for the keyboard to pop up and a note to be taken.  </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Created item "Buy new John Grisham book"</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1JohnGrisham.html" id="johnList"></iframe>
        <p> Once the user hits enter on their keyboard, the inputted note appears on the first available line, with a matching checkbox on the left side of the screen. Entries that are too long to fit onto one line will stretch onto additional lines as necessary.</p>

    </div>
    <H2>Non-empty List</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1NonEmptyList.html" id="nonEmptyList"></iframe>
        <p> By following the method from before, you can add lots of things to the list, each with a matching checkbox! </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Created item "Eat Lunch"</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1EatLunch.html" id="lunchList"></iframe>
        <p> You can add new elements to a non-empty list by tapping anywhere on or below the first empty line.</p>
    </div>
    <H2>Marked "Call Mom" as completed</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1CallMom.html" id="momList"></iframe>
        <p> To mark an item as complete, simply tap its matching checkbox. </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Renamed "Text John" to "Text John about bank statements"</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1BankStatements.html" id="bankList"></iframe>
        <p> You can tap the line of any existing entry, which brings up the keyboard and allows you to edit it again. Hitting enter replaces that entry, moving later list entries farther down on the page as needed to make room. </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Long Pressing Items</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1LongPress.html" id="longPressList"></iframe>
        <p> Individual list items can be highlighted as well. To do this, long press on its line until it is highlighted blue. For Lab 2, this will be implemented either by timing how long the mouse is over the line using JavaScript or through gesture handlers in React (examples include https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system and https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/). Once you highlight a single line using a long press, other elements can be highlighted as well using single taps on their respective lines. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1Highlighted.html" id="highlightedList"></iframe>
        <p> We have highlighted a bunch of lines! You may have noticed the new button in the bottom right of the screen. It shows up when any line is highlighted and allows the user to toggle whether the highlighted lines are visible or not. </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Hiding Items</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1Hidden.html" id="hiddenList"></iframe>
        <p> With the highlighted items hidden, two visual indicators remain to remind the user that they have hidden lines. Where highlighted items have been compressed between remaining lines, the light blue borders have been replaced with dotted black lines. Additionally, the toggle in the bottom right remains so that the user is able to reveal their highlighted elements again. </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Deleting Items</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1Highlighted.html" id="highlightedList2"></iframe>
        <p> You are also able to delete highlighted lines. This is done by placing your finger on one of the highlighted lines and swiping towards the right of the screen. Like the long press before, this will be done in Lab 2 either through original JavaScript or React libraries.  </p>
    </div>
    <H2>Swiping Gesture</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1Deleted.html" id="deletedList"></iframe>
        <p> After swiping right on the highlighted items, they are deleted permanently, leaving only the unhighlighted lines in the list.</p>
    </div>
    <H2>Homepage</H2>
    <div class="webpages">
        <iframe src="Lab1Home.html" id="home"></iframe>
        <p> One last feature! Hitting the back arrow at the top of the notes page takes you to a central home page. Here you can scroll through your existing lists, create new ones using the plus button in the bottom right, and check the settings menu. Our intent with this settings menu is to give the user flexibility in how the app looks, and it may include options for text size, font, and additional color palettes. These options may or may not manifest depending on how ambitious we are with Lab 2. </p>
